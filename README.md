# LeetcodeChallenge
Hi all,
In this repo we are going to solve and share leetcode challenges.
The goal of this forum is to enhance the coding and problem solving skills as well as code reviewing and presentation.
Each week I (Yaniv) will randomly choose  a problem from leetcode which will be Easy/Medium level problem.
The problem instructions (link to leetcode)  will be published under "Wiki".

Each one of us will solve the problem and will add his solution inside the folder of the problem like below:

LeetcodeChallenge/Container With Most Water/Yaniv/solution.py

Few ground rules:
1. Feel free to add comments on each others work
2. Please try to choose meaningful variable names
3. Post only solutions that passed ALL tests on leetcode

I will add an example for a problem and a solution
